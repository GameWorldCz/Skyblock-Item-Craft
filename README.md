# Skyblock-Item-Craft
Small python script to calculate craft price of an item.

To use, download all files in the repository, start "Calculate craft cost" and write the item you're looking for there. Name of an item should be in in auction house format (e.g. "Necron's Chestplate"). You need to have python 3 and package requests installed in order for this to work.

The code is trash but it works.

Feel free to use for whatever you want. Enjoy :D!
